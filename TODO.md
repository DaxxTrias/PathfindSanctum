# TODO
- Test SanctumStateTracker when you acquire a smoke affliction
- Finish dynamic weights
- Check if weights are actually accurate / useful
- Find a way to read active afflictions
- Account for active afflictions (if we have +1 affliction, it makes getting afflictions significantly worse)
- Swap to RoomsByLayer once it's available
- Find a way to read active relic bonuses
- [If 100% reduced trap damage taken -> 0 honour taken] -> set to 0 a bunch of afflictions (can reduce them dynamically by a %, but I don't think it's a high priority)
